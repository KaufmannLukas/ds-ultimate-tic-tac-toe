            <p>
            Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (U_T-T-T) is played on nine tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3 Ã— 3 grid. <br>
            Rules: Playing on a field inside a board (local game), determines the next board in which the opponent must play their next move. <br>
            The goal is to win three boards / local games in a row. You can play your next move at any board, <br>
            if you are directed to play in a full board or a board that has been won and therefore is already closed. <br>
