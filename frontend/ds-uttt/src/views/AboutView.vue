                <strong>XOXO&#178;</strong> is a project that uses Reinforced Learning to train an Model / Agent to play
                Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe. 
                
                    First we created a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) search algorithm from scratch.
                    Then we used an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to implement Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to improve
                    the performance and have a stronger agent...
